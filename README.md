# GDP Per Capita vs Women's Tertiary Education Analysis
## **DSA 210 Introduction to Data Science Project**
This data science project investigates the relationship between economic development (GDP per capita) and women's tertiary education rates across OECD countries. Through advanced statistical analysis, machine learning modeling, and hypothesis testing, the project explores how economic prosperity correlates with educational outcomes for women.

## Achievements
Successfully integrated multiple OECD datasets and achieved high predictive accuracy (R² > 0.7) using machine learning models, demonstrating strong correlations between economic and educational indicators.

### Goals
- **Quantify Economic-Education Relationship**: Measure correlation between GDP and women's education
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Include employment rates and fertility rates as additional predictors
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build machine learning models to predict education rates
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluate multiple ML algorithms for optimal performance
- **Policy Insights**: Generate evidence-based recommendations for educational development

### Technical Objectives
- Implement automated EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) pipeline
- Apply statistical hypothesis testing for significance validation
- Develop and compare 4 different machine learning models
- Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- Create comprehensive visualization suite

### Educational Policy Significance
Understanding the relationship between economic development and women's education provides crucial insights for policy makers in developing targeted interventions for educational advancement.

### Gender Equality Focus
Women's education is a key indicator of gender equality and social development, making this analysis relevant for understanding societal progress patterns.

### Evidence-Based Decision Making
Rather than assumptions, this project provides statistical evidence of economic factors influencing educational outcomes, supporting data-driven policy decisions.
